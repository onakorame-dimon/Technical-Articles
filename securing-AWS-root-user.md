We recommend as a best practice that right after you create your AWS account, you enable multi-factor authentication, or MFA, on the root user. 

MFA introduces an additional unique piece of information that you need to enter to gain access to the account.

On top of enabling MFA for the root user, we strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks


create account --> create IAM user (give perm to create other users) --->  login as IAM user for Admin tasks

--->  secure root credentials ---> disable access keys.
